# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Detected fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning with imbalanced data handling techniques.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. Since fraudulent activities are rare compared to normal transactions, the project emphasizes handling imbalanced data and improving model precision for the minority class.

## Objectives

-Detect fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy.

-Handle severe class imbalance using advanced resampling techniques.

-Compare multiple classification models and select the best performer.

## Techniques Used

-Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and standardized transaction data.

-Imbalanced Data Handling: Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance class distribution.

-Modeling: Built and compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers.

-Evaluation: Used Precision-Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate performance on the imbalanced dataset.

## Tools & Libraries

-Python

-Pandas, NumPy

-Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn

-XGBoost

-Matplotlib, Seaborn

-Jupyter Notebook

## Results

-XGBoost achieved an F1-score of 0.97, delivering strong detection capability.

-Improved minority (fraud) class detection by 20% after applying SMOTE.

-The model demonstrated high recall for fraud detection without excessive false positives.

## Visualizations

Include visuals such as:

-Confusion Matrix

-ROC Curve

-Precision-Recall Curve

-Feature Importance Plot

## Dataset Note

The dataset used in this project was provided as part of a DataMites course module and is not included in this repository due to access restrictions.

## Key Insights

-Balancing the dataset significantly improves model fairness and recall.

-Ensemble methods like XGBoost are highly effective for fraud detection.

-Precision and recall are more meaningful metrics than accuracy in imbalanced datasets.
